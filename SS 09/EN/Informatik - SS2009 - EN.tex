\begin{enumerate}
\item very big and dominant (A very large company with a great market share / which is dominant in it's sector)
\item to change an existing thing (to make changes to part of a process, system \ac{etc.} without changing the whole process)
\item to slowly loose things from an containment (unwanted/unintended emission from a closed system)
\item to insert the same amount of something into a smaller place with very few room (to put/push/force more and more items into a small space)
\item an alternative version of something or doing something with some few changes
\item to make something better or faster than previous versions (replace the old version)\\
		\Ra The USB quickly superseded the parallel and RS232 ports
\item to target a group of things (together/as a group)
\item to watch and use something and rate it after specific criteria
\item to not change something over a period of time
\item to make something faster than before (increase)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Because the old chips, which were used in desktops, weren't able to handle the amount of data which is used in multimedia applications. (Because image editing and multimedia applications need greater CPU\\$\begin{cases}\text{speed}\\\text{performance}\end{cases}$.)
\item The silicon becomes a better conductor. (The silicon becomes a better conductor\\$\begin{cases}\text{which makes the chip more efficient}\\\text{which increases processing speed}\end{cases}$.)
\item The loss of power. (This can lead to loss of data, processing errors, loss of performance generally and a shorter processor lifespan.)
\item The process is much larger and so has more space for memory. (The decreased width of components from 130nm to 90nm.)
\item There is older software which isn't using the advantage of the new instructions of the processor. (Because current applications have not been designed for the new chips (are not yet compatible with\dots).)
\item It allows the use of new processors with the old chip sets/motherboards. (Intel can produce the new chips without changing the production line, which saves a large amount of money.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{20.04.2009}
\begin{enumerate}
\item higher capacity (The higher capacity. - The times greater capacity.)
\item 51\%
\item They can securely disposed with simple tools (Standard DVDs cannot be disposed of easily, and sensitive data can be retrieved from discs which people throw away.)
\item In the near future (THis is not known. - This has not been announced yet.)
\item They use a blue laser instead of a red one (Paper discs will use blue laser technology, where current conventional DVDs use red laser.)
\item 25GB
\item 4.7GB
\item Because paper discs cannot hold an substrate which is needed by the red laser technology. (Red laser light needs to pass through a substrate to read and write data. Paper cannot easily bond with a substrate. Red laser light would set fire to the paper.)
\item They are cheaper in production because of the missing substrate and the cheapness of paper. (They can be produced more cheaply.)
\item They they say that they don't know what the practical uses could be. (They say they don't know.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{How should you write technical documents}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The language is impersonal
		\begin{itemize}[label=\ra]
		\item Do not use ''I'', do not use ''you''
		\item If a human agent is part of the process, then the function is used e.g. ''the user'', ''the operator'', ''the administrator'', ''the programmer'' etc.
		\item 
		\end{itemize}
\item
